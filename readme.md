See http://triton.ironhelmet.com/. If you're still confused, you probably don't care.
NOTE: This is completely unofficial and not endorsed by the game's author. He just happens to provide a reasonable JSON interface :)

Requirements:
-------------
Mac OS X 10.8+

Optional:
---------
If you use Chrome and keep the game open in a tab/window, this app will automatically pull cookie data from Chrome's cookie database. Only cookies for triton.ironhelmet.com are read.

Features:
---------
* Projected Cashflow
* Share sensor data for other players you can see (not your own stars/fleets or data other players are sharing with you) with other players via the neptunesPrideServer project
* Sortable table of player information with planet breakdowns
* Scroll through the game history tick by tick
* Local notifications whenever a fleet enters sensor range or launches from a visible planet. Plus, combat outcome predictions accounting for production, active research, and reinforcements in transit!

Known Issues:
-------------
* Doesn't account for warp gates
* Pulling shared data is not fully implemented and is untested
* Sorting players based on technology stats may cause a crash
* Assume you only play one game at a time

Note also that the JSON data powering this app is NOT a formal API and is subject to change without notice. If this occurs, the app will probably require an update.
